    <h1>Pride Layer Cake</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>5 large egg whites</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>food coloring in 6 rainbow colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease six 9-inch round cake pans and dust with flour.</li>
        <li>Sift together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda.</li>
        <li>Beat 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter, milk, sugar, egg whites, and vanilla extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Stir in flour mixture and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Divide cake batter evenly between 6 bowls. Mix in different food coloring to each bowl, creating 6 different colored batters. Start with just 1 to 2 drops of food coloring in each bowl, then mix; you can always add more.</li>
        <li>Bake each cake in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
    </ol>
